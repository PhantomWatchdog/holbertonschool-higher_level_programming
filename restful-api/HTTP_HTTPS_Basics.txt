HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, while HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure.

HTTP transfers data in an readable format, while HTTPS transfers data in encrypted format.

HTTPS uses an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate to create a secure encrypted connection between the client and the server.

HTTP operates at the application layer of the OSI model, while HTTPS operates at the transport layer.

HTTP uses port 80 for communication, while HTTPS uses port 443.

About performance, HTTPS is slower than HTTP because it need additional steps for encryption and decryption of the data.

About security, HTTPS is more secure than HTTP and is therefore recommended for websites that handle sensitive data, such as credit card information and user credentials.
